## Section Training & Education and DALIA
The <span style="color:#0abaf0">NFDI Section Training & Education</span> aims to <span style="color:#0abaf0">raise awareness of research data management</span> and to <span style="color:#0abaf0">promote competences in this area</span> in order to support the quality and sustainability of research results.
---

**The Section's paradigm is**: <big><span style="color:#0abaf0" >**data literacy from the start!**</span></big>

--> <span style="color:#0abaf0">Thus the work of the section is relevant to a wide range of target groups.</span>
---

The [DALIA (Data Literacy Alliance)](https://dalia.education/) project is part of the sections activities. It contributes to the implementation of the section´s paradigm by developing a platform for teaching and learning materials in the field of research data management.

## What is a persona?

>![Frage](images/teaching-mouse_what.png) <!-- width="100px" align="right" -->
>
>The **persona method** has its **origin** in the field of **software development** and was and still is used for optimizing **human-computer-interactions**.
>
>Today the method is used for various purposes in different fields, most notably in design, marketing, and user-centered development processes.

> “Personas are user archetypes that characterise the needs, goals, technical experience, accessibility requirements and other personal characteristics of larger groups of people.”
>
> -- [Mariana Lilley, Andrew Pyper & Sue Attwood (2012)](https://doi.org/10.11120/ital.2012.11010004)

> “A persona is a fictional character built that models actual users. It’s not a real person; however, it’s built on common characteristics that your learners share.”
>
> -- [Huprich (2019)](https://medium.com/@juliahuprich/building-learner-personas-for-instructional-design-effectiveness-8787d4e5d1d2)

> “The idea: Instead of assuming an anonymous mass, people with concrete names, professions, hobbies, habits, values, etc. are created.”
>
> -- [NFDI4Biodiversity](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/en/personas/)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Why personas?

>**Personas can in general can help us in developing, maintaining and improving EduTrain services**:
>
>![Frage](images/teaching-mouse_why.png) <!-- width="100px" align="right" -->
>
>-> **User-Centered Design**: Personas can help to design services, systems and learning offers, having the end users in mind. By creating detailed and relatable profiles of target users, we can better understand user needs, behaviors, and preferences.
>
>->  **Empathy and Understanding**: Personas provide a human face to abstract user groups. They can help us to empathize with users and their goals, motivations and pain points, leading to better designs and decision-making.
>
>-> **Communication**: Personas can simplify communication. Instead of referring to vague user groups, personas provide a concrete reference point. They can enable us to share a common understanding of who the users are and what they want. Personas can also be used to tailor messages and campaigns to specific user groups.
>
>-> **Prioritization**: We may identify primary, secondary, and tertiary user types. This might help us to prioritize features, functionalities, and improvements based on the needs and goals of the most important user segments.
>
>-> **Testing and Validation**: Personas can be used to guide usability testing and validation efforts. Thus personas can be used to create realistic scenarios for testing, ensuring that user interactions and feedback are relevant to the intended audience.
>
>-> **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Personas may also help in encouraging collaboration as shared personas ensure everyone works towards a common understanding of the user base.

## Existing personas in NFDI consortia

Some NFDI consortia have already worked on personas or archaetypes to decribe their users.

The cosortia focus on subject-specific needs and interests, while the EduTrain section with its activities is active across different disciplines and focuses education and training needs in the field of data management. Personas or archaetypes decribed by consortia are also possible users of the section training and education.

><big>**Have a look at them here:**</big>
>
>* [NFDI4Biodiversity](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/en/personas/)
>
>* [NFDI4Ing](https://nfdi4ing.de/archetypes/)
>
>* NFDI4DataScience
>
>**If you are aware of more existing personas/archaetypes within other NFDI consortia, please leave us a note *(preferably with a link to the resource or a contact)* at the general comment section of the persona [miro-Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMptzbjA=/?moveToWidget=3458764563028176872&cot=14)!**

## EduTrain: Main User Groups

The user group of the section EduTrain and DALIA is diverse. We expect users, from students to PIs, as well as from lecturers to research support staff working at libraries and computer centers or administrative areas.

Due to time constraints, we have reduced the number of user groups to three main groups, of which we would like you to help describe one representative at a time:

1. [**Learners**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMptzbjA=/?moveToWidget=3458764563238869741&cot=14)
2. [**Lecturers**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMptzbjA=/?moveToWidget=3458764563729042924&cot=14)
3. [**Assistants**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMptzbjA=/?moveToWidget=3458764563729192386&cot=14)

Please visit our Miro-Board and help us to 

1. describe the main user groups, by naming all subgroups who you can think of may fit to the three main user groups, assign existing personas from NFDI consortia
2. leave characterising notes and comments to describe one persona as a representive for each main user group

>Please help us to describe personas/archetypes that characterise the needs, goals, technical experience, accessibility requirements and other personal characteristics of the EduTrain main user groups and take some time to meet them!

### ~~The public and interested non-experts~~: Meet Paul 
Depending on the orientation of the training courses, members of the public and interested laypersons can also benefit from the offerings in order to develop a better understanding of research data and its importance. What kind of activities could be of interest for the public and interested non-experts?
